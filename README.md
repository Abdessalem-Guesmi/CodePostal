# CodePostal
SpringBoot-AngularJs Project
in the first project into github submit, i have the web application with name CodePostal executed

this application with SpringBoot executed
  Backend:
- Data-Base with Type Mysql(named banque_tn)

the application is based on the principle of the reversal of control via SpringBoot

 - it is composed of four layers:

     * The DAO layer whose I created the entities, creation of the JPA Repository interfaces. Spring DATA which loads all that concerns the relational object mapping (ORM), which uses in particular JPA, Hibernate and JDBC for the communication with the database (of type MySql)

     * the business layer, I created the interfaces and implemented them to define the different methods that I used (business layer and dao are linked via the interfaces).

     

      * The service layer or controller I used the Restfull service to expose API-Rest based on the HTTP protocol.
this back-end part takes the architecture of a Maven project ..

MVC client based on HTML5, AngularJs and bootstrap is the Web part and the communication is via HTTP and the format used is the JSON format.
